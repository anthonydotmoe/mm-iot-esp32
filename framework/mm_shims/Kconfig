            The Board Configuration File (BCF) is a configuration file for the Morse Micro chip that provides
            board-specific information and is required for the system to function properly. BCFs for Morse Micro
            modules are included in the MM-IoT-SDK package. These modules can be identified by the part numbers
            printed on their labels, which take the form MM6108-MFxxxxxx.
